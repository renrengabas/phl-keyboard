## Usage instructions
1. Download and install the AutoHotkey program from autohotkey.com
   After installing the program, it will only show a help document. DO NOT PANIC. You have installed the program correctly.
2. Download the AutoHotkeyU64.ahk file into your main Documents folder.
   * Right-click the AutoHotkeyU64.ahk file and "Run Script". You should now see an [H] icon in your system tray. 
   * If you have time, restart your computer to see if the file autoloads properly.
3. Once you have the .ahk file loaded properly, type away =)

## Need your special symbol added to the list?
Easy, just fork the code and edit. Feel free to do a pull request so that your changes can be added back to the main branch.

If forking, editing and pulling requests present a challenge, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:renrengabas@gmail.com) with your symbol of desire and suggested shortcut key. My main requirement is that it has to be a symbol supported by the Arial font.
